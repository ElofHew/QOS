Quarter OS End-User EULA - Oak Studio

Thank you for choosing QOS! We hope you can enjoy it.

QOS is a Fake Operating System powered by Python 3. The full name of QOS is "Quarter Operating System," but it is NOT RELATED TO "QoS" in Network Technology.

By using QOS, you agree to the following End-User EULA:
1. QOS may record your actions and some data on your computer and may access and modify other files and retrieve your personal information.
2. Oak Studio is not responsible for any damage to your computer while using QOS, unless you provide sufficient evidence that QOS contains malicious code that causes such damage.
3. We do not recommend using QOS in important or production environments as it may not be very stable.
4. You should not use QOS for illegal or unethical purposes and must not use it to harm other people or organizations.
5. You cannot use QOS in business or enterprise environments.
6. You must not sell QOS on the Internet or any other platform without our permission.
7. Please comply with the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3.0 to distribute QOS.

Additional Terms:
8. **Support and Maintenance**: Oak Studio provides support for QOS, but the extent of support is limited to the resources available. Users should regularly check for updates.
9. **Intellectual Property**: All rights in QOS are reserved by Oak Studio. Users may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble QOS without explicit permission.
10. **Termination of Agreement**: This agreement may be terminated by Oak Studio at any time if you violate any of the terms. Users may also terminate the agreement by uninstalling QOS.

Attention:
1. QOS is not like subsystems (such as Windows Subsystem for Linux), a real operating system, or a virtual machine.
2. Some incorrect actions in QOS may destroy the QOS system and files on your computer.
3. As you can, please avoid using Ctrl+C in KomShell, as this may cause the QOS system to crash.
